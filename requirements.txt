# Requirements for RL-Based Object Selection
# Install with: C:\isaacsim\python.bat -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# IMPORTANT: See OPENCV_PYGAME_ANALYSIS.md before installing!

# CRITICAL: NumPy version constraint for Isaac Sim compatibility
# Isaac Lab, scipy, nvidia-srl-usd, and numba all require numpy<2.0.0
numpy<2.0.0,>=1.24.0

# CRITICAL: OpenCV headless version for Isaac Sim compatibility
# opencv-python requires numpy>=2 which breaks Isaac Sim!
# Use opencv-python-headless instead (already installed, but pinning version)
opencv-python-headless>=4.8.0,<5.0.0

# Core RL framework (NOT in Isaac Sim - needs installation)
stable-baselines3[extra]>=2.0.0

# Pygame for visualization (NOT in Isaac Sim - SAFE to install)
pygame>=2.5.0
